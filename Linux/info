Linux - A multiuser (resources are shared between all users) & multitasking system

case sensitive - files, folders, terminal

Kernel - interacts with the machines hardware & the shell
	Path - /boot/vmlinuz

Shell - command interpreter - send the input from user to kernal & displays the output from kernal to user
	default - Bash
	It is a programming language.

System Calls - commands access the kernal throught the set of functions

internal commands - built in commands that are not stored as separate files & shell won't look in its PATH to execute
	prioritize this, if both internal & external commands are present.

external commands - commands that are stored as a seperate files & shell look for PATH to execute.

whitespace - string of spaces & tabs together

Command Line - command options... arguments...

options - special argument which are predetermined
	used with -/-- sign
	multiple options can be combined with only one - sign

	why options with - sign? -> we have a filename, string as an arguments

FileName Argument - command can take the input from the file.
	it will generally be at the last of a command after all options

Buffer - temporary storage in memeory maintained by kernel for all keyboard input.

UNIX consider everything as a file.

Escape sequence - 2 char string beginning with a \

file attributes are kept in a separate area of hard disk.
all physical devices, shell, main memeory are also treated as file.

ordinary/regular file - data as stream of char
	contains:
		text file - each line is terminated with newline char
		binary file - range of ascii entries (0 - 255)
directory file - entry of everyfile & sub directories
	contains: file name, inode
	kernel can only write directory file
device file - all devices & peripherals
	path - /dev
	contains: nothing

	all these are organized in a hierarchical structure ( inverted tree - top is called as root & is represented by / )
	
filename:
	can contain 255 char
	may or may not have extension (no rule)
	any ascii char except / & null
		
Absolute pathname - located with reference to the root (/)

Relative pathname - located with reference to current dir or parent dir resp (. | ..)
		
.profile - contain the set of instructions that are performed when user logs in.

Administrator had full rights to do anything

every file type has a unique magic number which is embedded in the 1st few bytes of file

data can be
	file
	pipe
	data stream
	user input

end of line in 
	windows - \r\n - CR LF
	linux - \n - LF

	conversion of file from windows to linux is simple by removing the \r, mostly done automatic
	lly, conversion of file from linux to windows is to add \r explicitly 

archive - group a set of files into a single file

1st compress then archive
1st extract archive then decompress

1 Nibble = 4 Bit
8 Bits = 1 Byte
1024 Bytes = 1 Kilobyte
1024 Kilobytes = 1 Megabyte
1024 Megabytes = 1 Gigabyte
1024 Gigabytes = 1 Terabyte
1024 Terabytes = 1 Petabyte
1024 Petabytes = 1 Exabyte
1024 Exabytes = 1 Zettabyte
1024 Zettabytes = 1 Yottabyte
1024 Yottabytes = 1 Brontobyte
1024 Brontobytes = 1 Geopbyte

1 Block = 1024 Bytes

owner has its own set of permissions that override the group owners permission

read & write permission on a ordinary file is influenced by directory housing them.
	file permission - 000 - useless file but we can delete it
	file permission - 777 - all permission to a file but we can't delte it
